# Kotlin `takeLastWhile` Explained with Examples and Use-Cases

The `takeLastWhile` function in Kotlin is a powerful tool for string manipulation. It allows you to extract characters from the end of a string as long as they satisfy a given condition. This guide explains its usage with detailed examples and practical use-cases.

---

## **Function Overview**

### **Signature**
```kotlin
fun String.takeLastWhile(predicate: (Char) -> Boolean): String
```

### **Parameters**
- `predicate`: A lambda function that defines the condition for each character.

### **Return Value**
A new string containing characters from the end of the string that satisfy the condition. If no characters match, it returns an empty string.

---

## **How it Works**
1. Starts evaluating characters from the last character of the string.
2. Accumulates characters as long as the condition (`predicate`) is `true`.
3. Stops and returns the collected characters as soon as the condition becomes `false`.

## **Examples**

### **1. Extracting Digits from the End of a String**
```kotlin
val text = "Order12345"
val digits = text.takeLastWhile { it.isDigit() }
println(digits) // Output: "12345"
```
**Explanation**: Starting from the end, digits (`5`, `4`, `3`, etc.) are collected until a non-digit character is encountered.

---

### **2. Extracting a Lowercase Suffix**
```kotlin
val fileName = "MyFileName.txt"
val suffix = fileName.takeLastWhile { it.isLowerCase() }
println(suffix) // Output: "txt"
```
**Explanation**: Characters from the end are collected as long as they are lowercase.

---

### **3. Extracting Specific Characters (e.g., Vowels)**
```kotlin
val word = "helloeeea"
val vowels = word.takeLastWhile { it in "aeiou" }
println(vowels) // Output: "eeea"
```
**Explanation**: Starting from the end, vowels (`a`, `e`, `e`, `e`) are collected until a non-vowel is encountered.

---

### **4. No Matching Characters**
```kotlin
val text = "Kotlin12345"
val result = text.takeLastWhile { it.isUpperCase() }
println(result) // Output: ""
```
**Explanation**: No uppercase letters are found at the end, so the result is an empty string.

---

## **Use-Cases**

### **1. Parsing File Extensions**
Extract file extensions where the extension contains only lowercase letters.
```kotlin
val filePath = "report.final.docx"
val extension = filePath.takeLastWhile { it.isLowerCase() }
println(extension) // Output: "docx"
```

---

### **2. Validating Trailing Characters**
Verify if the trailing characters in a string are all digits.
```kotlin
val input = "TransactionID123456"
val isTrailingDigits = input.takeLastWhile { it.isDigit() }.length == 6
println(isTrailingDigits) // Output: true
```

---

### **3. Extracting Measurement Units**
For strings like `"75kg"` or `"180cm"`, extract the unit suffix.
```kotlin
val measurement = "75kg"
val unit = measurement.takeLastWhile { it.isLetter() }
println(unit) // Output: "kg"
```

---

### **4. Processing Log Entries**
Extract specific codes or patterns from the end of log entries.
```kotlin
val logEntry = "ERROR2024: Something went wrong CODE_503"
val code = logEntry.takeLastWhile { it.isDigit() || it == '_' || it.isUpperCase() }
println(code) // Output: "CODE_503"
```

---

### **5. Dynamic Filters**
Apply dynamic conditions to extract trailing data:
```kotlin
val message = "abc#123"
val result = message.takeLastWhile { it.isLetterOrDigit() }
println(result) // Output: "123"
```

---

## **Key Points**
- `takeLastWhile` creates a new string without modifying the original string.
- It stops processing as soon as the condition fails, ensuring efficiency.
- Ideal for string parsing, pattern recognition, and filtering tasks.
