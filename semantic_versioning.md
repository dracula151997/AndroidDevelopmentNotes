## Semantic Versioning

This project follows **Semantic Versioning** (`x.y.z`), where:

- **`x` (Major version)**: Indicates major changes or incompatible API updates. Incrementing this number signifies significant feature additions or breaking changes.
- **`y` (Minor version)**: Represents backward-compatible feature enhancements. Changes to this number mean new features have been added without breaking existing functionality.
- **`z` (Patch version)**: Denotes bug fixes or minor improvements. Incrementing this number reflects small changes that don't impact functionality or introduce breaking changes.

Example: A version `2.5.1` suggests the second major release, with the fifth minor update, and one patch applied since the last minor update.
