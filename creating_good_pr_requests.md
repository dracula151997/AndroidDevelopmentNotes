### 1. **Clear Title and Description**
   - **Title:** Provide a concise and meaningful title that summarizes the PR's purpose (e.g., “Add user authentication using Firebase”).
   - **Description:** Include a detailed description of what the PR does. Explain the context, problem, and how your changes solve it. Use bullet points or numbered lists for clarity.

### 2. **Keep It Focused and Small**
   - **Single Purpose:** Focus the PR on a single feature, bug fix, or improvement. Avoid mixing unrelated changes to make reviews easier and faster.
   - **Small PRs:** Break down large changes into smaller, logical PRs when possible. Smaller PRs are easier to review, test, and merge.

### 3. **Follow Project Coding Guidelines**
   - Stick to your project's established coding standards for formatting, naming conventions, and architecture (e.g., MVVM).
   - Run static analysis tools (e.g., Android Lint, ktlint) to ensure your code adheres to the standards.

### 4. **Include Meaningful Commit Messages**
   - Use clear, descriptive commit messages that explain the “what” and “why” of each change.
   - Consider breaking up changes into logically grouped commits.

### 5. **Provide Screenshots/Recordings (If Applicable)**
   - For UI changes, include screenshots or screen recordings in the PR description to demonstrate the changes visually.
   - This helps reviewers understand the impact quickly.

### 6. **Add Unit Tests and Documentation**
   - Include unit tests or integration tests for your changes, especially for critical logic or new features.
   - Update documentation, if necessary, such as README files or inline comments.

### 7. **Tag Relevant Reviewers and Use Labels**
   - Request reviews from specific team members or experts who should review the changes.
   - Use labels to categorize the PR (e.g., “feature,” “bug,” “documentation”).

### 8. **Link Related Issues**
   - If your PR addresses an existing issue, link it in the description (e.g., “Resolves #123”).
   - This provides context and automatically closes the issue when the PR is merged.

### 9. **Test Your Changes Thoroughly**
   - Ensure your changes work as intended by running the app, automated tests, and relevant test cases.
   - Check for regressions or edge cases.

### 10. **Add Code Comments Where Necessary**
   - Add comments to clarify complex code sections or explain non-obvious logic.
   - Use comments to guide reviewers about any trade-offs or areas that need extra attention.

### 11. **Rebase and Squash (If Needed)**
   - Rebase your branch onto the latest main branch before opening a PR to avoid merge conflicts.
   - Squash commits if your team prefers a clean commit history.

### 12. **Be Open to Feedback**
   - Be prepared to address feedback promptly and respectfully.
   - Iterate on your PR based on reviewer comments and mark resolved issues or suggestions.
