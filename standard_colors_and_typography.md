This table view provides a quick reference to ensure consistent and intuitive use of your app's color scheme across various components.
Hereâ€™s a detailed guide on which style to use for each typography in your `Typography` class, considering common use cases and design hierarchy in apps:

### 1. Display Styles
These styles are meant to grab attention and are typically used sparingly due to their size and prominence.

- **displayLarge**: Use this for very prominent headers, splash screens, or feature screens where you want to capture user attention.
- **displayMedium**: Ideal for secondary-level display headers, titles on important screens, or promotional banners.
- **displaySmall**: Great for sub-headers, featured elements on dashboards, or text that needs emphasis without dominating the UI.

### 2. Headline Styles
These styles are used for section headings or significant pieces of content that require more visual weight than body text.

- **headlineLarge**: Use for major section headers or titles on primary app screens.
- **headlineMedium**: Good for sub-sections within major screens or secondary headlines.
- **headlineSmall**: Use for tertiary headings or small content sections within screens, offering a structured hierarchy.

### 3. Title Styles
Titles are generally used for medium-emphasis text elements and shorter pieces of text.

- **titleLarge**: Best for top-level dialog titles, app bar titles, or card titles in larger containers.
- **titleMedium**: Suitable for secondary titles, section headers in lists, or key data titles.
- **titleSmall**: Useful for item titles in lists, subtitles, or small but meaningful text labels.

### 4. Body Styles
Body styles are designed for main content text and descriptions.

- **bodyLarge**: Use for main paragraphs, detailed descriptions, or important body text.
- **bodyMedium**: This is a great default for general content text such as descriptions and articles.
- **bodySmall**: Best for supporting text, disclaimers, or captions within the content.

### 5. Label Styles
Labels are used for smaller, less prominent text elements.

- **labelLarge**: Use for prominent labels, buttons, or input field labels that need some emphasis.
- **labelMedium**: Ideal for form labels, navigation text, or tags within the UI.
- **labelSmall**: Great for annotations, secondary captions, or small buttons.
